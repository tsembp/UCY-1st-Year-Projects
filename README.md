# 🎓 First-Year University Projects
This repository contains Java coding assignments completed during my first year of university. Each project showcases different computer science concepts, including algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming principles.

## Semester 1️⃣:

#### 🧬 DNA Sequencer (HW1)
> A program that processes and analyzes DNA sequences using string manipulation and pattern matching algorithms. The project focuses on understanding sequence alignments and genetic matching.

#### 🧩 N-Puzzle (HW2)
> Implementation of the classic N-Puzzle game, which includes a search algorithm to find the optimal solution. This project highlights problem-solving and algorithmic thinking with puzzles of varying difficulty.

#### 🔢 Sudoku Solver (HW3)
> A backtracking algorithm used to solve Sudoku puzzles while ensuring valid configurations for rows, columns, and 3x3 blocks. This project strengthens skills in recursive algorithms and constraint satisfaction problems.

## Semester 2️⃣:

#### 💻 Rich Array & Negadecimal to Decimal Calculator (HW1)
> A custom array data structure along with an advanced calculator that converts between negadecimal and decimal number systems, and vice versa. This assignment covers number system conversions and implementing unique data structures.

#### ✈️ Travel Office Management System (HW2)
> A console-based system for managing travel bookings, clients, and packages using object-oriented programming principles. This project emphasizes the development of modular, maintainable code.

#### ♟️ Squarelotron & Chess (HW3)
> A dual-part assignment: the first part implements the Squarelotron puzzle, while the second part develops a simplified chess game. The focus here is on game logic and grid-based movement mechanics.

#### 🍢 Kebab Store Management (HW4)
> A system for managing orders and inventory for a fictional kebab store. It generates a list of orders and the main system takes the orders and prepares them like in real-time. This project focuses on object-oriented programming.
